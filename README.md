Shopping Hub (Basically a Shopping Application) Developed in C Language Using file handling. This is a very small Project as my intention behind uploading this project, is only to help college/school students who wants to build small project in C Language, So don't keep expectation that high.

Steps to Run the Project:

Put All The files at one Place (Together)
Make Two Folders Users and Products. // I Have already Added in Repo. (Just Go and run the files and Have Fun!)

Working :-
There are two parts of Project 
Client and Admin

Client side Includes: Login,signup,placing order and casual options that you usually see in any shopping app (Users folder will be use, Whenever you signup new file will get generated So Users folder is must however you can change the code accordingly)

Admin side includes : Add Product, Category and Removal See User Information and all Orders Extra

As i made this project in a chill mode so i have not add that huge conditioning and options (Actually that is the good part )

You can use this Project in any way.
Thankyou.
